# ⚽ Soccer Multi-Object Tracking & Behavior Analysis

This repository contains an advanced Computer Vision pipeline for detection, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), and behavior analysis of soccer players in match broadcast videos (based on the SoccerNet dataset).

*Note: This project was developed as a final assignment for the Artificial Vision course.*

## 🧠 System Architecture
The project integrates several models and filtering techniques to ensure robust tracking even in conditions of heavy occlusion and motion blur:

1. **Object Detection (YOLO/RT-DETR):** Fine-tuned model to extract bounding boxes of players and referees.
2. **Feature Extraction (Hybrid Re-ID):** A custom hybrid architecture combining:
   * **OSNet** (Lightweight CNN backbone)
   * **CBAM** (Channel & Spatial Attention Module)
   * **Vision Transformer (ViT)** (To capture global dependencies)
   * **GeM Pooling** (Generalized Mean Pooling)
3. **Tracking (BoTSORT):** The tracker has been modified with a hot-swap to directly integrate our custom hybrid feature extractor.

## 🛡️ Pre-Tracking Filtering Modules
To reduce false positives and improve ID-switch metrics, spatial logic modules are implemented:
* **Field Masking (RANSAC):** Automatically excludes detections outside the playing field (e.g., benches, stands).
* **Batch Shadow Filtering:** Mitigates errors caused by harsh shadows on the pitch.
* **Anti-Ghosting (Blur Artifacts):** Removes duplicate bounding boxes generated by rapid movements and motion blur.

## 📊 Behavior Analysis
The system maps the players' foot coordinates calculated in each frame and verifies their inclusion within specific **Regions of Interest (ROI)** to count the presence of subjects in specific areas of the pitch.

## 🚀 How to use this project
To run the `.ipynb` notebook, you will need to download the SoccerNet dataset and update the local paths accordingly.
